# crow-eat-the-worm
a simple game made in pygame, where a crow eats a worm, featuring flappy bird physics, and buggy controller support! (also buggy code)
#controls
to play the game, you can use the arrows to move and to jump. or a controller's dpad, or the joystick, which is really buggy! you can also use 'A' on the controller to jump, you use L1 or R on the game over screen to play the game again! (controller only supports xbox 360 layout, you can change that by contributing!)
